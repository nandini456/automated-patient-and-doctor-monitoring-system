Approximately 805,000 Americans have a heart attack each year. Knowing the signs of trouble and getting emergency medical help immediately can dramatically increase your chances of survival and recovery.\n\nA heart attack is not always a sudden, deadly event. Often it is an evolving process during which a clot forms in an artery of the heart, depriving the heart of blood and oxygen. The longer the heart attack process continues, the more permanent damage is done to otherwise healthy heart muscle.\n\nLay rescuers can be trained to operate portable, computerized, automated external defibrillators (AEDs) used to apply electric shock to restart a heart that has developed a chaotic rhythm called ventricular fibrillation, the most common cause of sudden cardiac arrest.\n\nMany people ignore the warning signs of a heart attack or wait until their symptoms become unbearable before seeking medical help. Others wait until they are absolutely sure it‚Äôs a heart attack because they worry they will look foolish if it is a false alarm. These reactions can result in dangerous delays.\n\nOnly skilled medical professionals can determine if someone is having a heart attack. Your responsibility is to recognize the warning signs and act quickly. If you are having a heart attack, you may be moved from the emergency department to a catheterization lab to receive angioplasty or a stent, or possibly heart bypass surgery. In addition, hospitals have lifesaving medications that are designed to stop a heart attack by dissolving the clot and restoring blood flow to the heart, although these medications work best when given within the first one or two hours after the onset of heart attack symptoms, when the damage is still limited.   \n\nPeople often will experience some, but not all, of the following symptoms, which may come and go:\n\n- Uncomfortable pressure, fullness, squeezing sensation or pain in the center of the chest, lasting more than a few minutes, or it goes away and comes back.\n- Pain that spreads to the shoulders, neck, jaw, arms or back.\n- Chest discomfort accompanied by lightheadedness, fainting, sweating, nausea or shortness of breath.\n- Some less common warning signs of heart attack that should be taken seriously ‚Äî especially if they accompany any of the above symptoms ‚Äî include:\n\nShortness of breath and difficulty breathing.\nAbnormal chest pain (angina), stomach, or abdominal pain. (Symptoms may feel like indigestion or heartburn.)\nNausea or dizziness.\nUnexplained anxiety, weakness, or fatigue.\nPalpitations, cold sweat or paleness.\nAs with men, women‚Äôs most common heart attack symptom is chest pain or discomfort. Women are more likely than men to experience shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting and back or jaw pain.\n\nIf you suspect someone is having a heart attack:\n\nCall 911 or your emergency services number immediately. Stay with the person until the ambulance arrives. Do not attempt to drive the person to the hospital; if his or her condition should worsen, there is nothing you can do to help while driving.\nAfter 911 is called, the EMS dispatcher will likely give pre-arrival instructions (when appropriate) for the administration of aspirin (not acetaminophen, ibuprofen or naproxen) and nitroglycerin (if prescribed) while emergency-response units are enroute to the scene The ideal aspirin dose in such instances is two to four baby aspirin or one full or extra strength tablet (325 or 500mg), and chewing helps get the aspirin into the bloodstream faster than swallowing it whole. (The patient should not be given aspirin if his or her physician has advised otherwise, e.g., because of allergies or possible harmful interactions with other medications or known disease complications).\nIf the person is conscious, keep the person calm and help him or her into a comfortable position. The victim should stop all physical activity, lie down, loosen clothing around the chest area, and remain calm until the ambulance arrives.\nIf the person becomes unconscious, make sure the person is lying on his or her back. Clear the airway and loosen clothing at the neck, chest and waist. Check for breathing and pulse; if absent, and if trained to do so, begin CPR.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"content\"></a>    \n<!-- <div style=\"border-radius:20px; padding: 15px; font-size:110%; text-align:left; background-image: url(https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8TRARmNBwwicbtL7yemkBX-1200-80.jpg); background-size: cover\"> -->\n\n<font style=\"font-family:Georgia; font-size:210%;\"> üî†Table Content </font><br>\n\n * **[Step 1 | About Dataset](#about_dataset)**\n * **[Step 2 | Python Libraries](#setup)**\n    -  [1.1 | Import Libraries](#import)\n *  **[Step 3 | Data](#data)**\n    -  [2.1 | Importing Data](#load_data)\n    -  [2.2 | Data Informations](#info)\n    -  [2.3 | Noise Detection ](#Noise)\n    -  [2.4 | Overview of Dataset ](#Overview)\n    -  [2.5 | Ratio of columns ](#Ratio)\n *  **[Step 4 | EDA](#EDA)**\n    -  [4.0 | Pair Plots](#Pair_Plots1)\n    -  [4.1 | Pair Plots With hue target](#Pair_Plots2)\n    -  [4.2 | Scatter Plots](#Scatter_Plots)\n    -  [4.3 | Histogram Plots](#Hist_Plots)\n    -  [4.4 | Count Plots](#Count_Plots1)\n    -  [4.5 | Kde Plots](#Kde_Plots)\n    -  [4.6 | Swarm Plots](#Swarm_Plots)\n    -  [4.7 | Pie Plots](#Pie_Plots1)\n    -  [4.8 | Radar Plots](#Radar_Plots)\n    -  [4.9 | Box Plots and Kde Plots](#kde_box_Plots)\n    -  [4.10 | Correlations](#corr)\n    -  [4.11 | Count Plots With hue target](#hue)\n    \n *  **[Step 5 | Modeling](#ml)**\n    -  [5.1 | LinearRegression](#lr)\n    -  [5.2 | DecisionTreeRegressor](#tree)\n    -  [5.3 | RandomForestRegressor](#rf)\n    -  [5.6 | Result](#result)\n *  **[Author](#author)**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style = 'border : 3px solid non; background-color:#F0FFFF ; ;padding:10px'>\n\n<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"about_dataset\"></a>\n\n<p style=\"font-family:Georgia;padding:20px;line-height:25px;\";><font style=\"font-family:Georgia; font-size:210%;\"> üëÅ‚Äçüó®About Dataset </font><br>\nEvery day, the average human heart beats around 100,000 times, pumping 2,000 gallons of blood through the body. Inside your body there are 60,000 miles of blood vessels.\n\nThe signs of a woman having a heart attack are much less noticeable than the signs of a male. In women, heart attacks may feel uncomfortable squeezing, pressure, fullness, or pain in the center of the chest. It may also cause pain in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach, shortness of breath, nausea and other symptoms. Men experience typical symptoms of heart attack, such as chest pain , discomfort, and stress. They may also experience pain in other areas, such as arms, neck , back, and jaw, and shortness of breath, sweating, and discomfort that mimics heartburn.\n\nIt‚Äôs a lot of work for an organ which is just like a large fist and weighs between 8 and 12 ounces.\n\nsource: healthblog.uofmhealth\n    \n**What is the dataset about?**\n   <br>\n    \nHeart Disease (including Coronary Heart Disease, Hypertension, and Stroke) remains the No. 1\ncause of death in the US.The Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics‚Äî2019 Update from the **American Heart Association** indicates that:\n* 116.4 million, or 46% of US adults are estimated to have hypertension. These are findings related to the new 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n* On average, someone dies of CVD every 38 seconds. About 2,303 deaths from CVD each day, based on 2016 data.\n* On average, someone dies of a stroke every 3.70 minutes.

Let's clarify:1. **Asymptomatic Angina**: This term doesn't typically exist in medical terminology. Angina refers to chest pain or discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. Asymptomatic means \"without symptoms.\" If someone has angina, by definition, they have symptoms such as chest pain or discomfort. If there are no symptoms, it wouldn't be considered angina.2. **Typical Angina**: This term refers to chest pain or discomfort that is typical or characteristic of angina. It typically presents as a feeling of pressure, squeezing, or tightness in the chest. It often occurs during physical exertion or emotional stress and is relieved by rest or medication.3. **Atypical Angina**: This term refers to chest pain or discomfort that doesn't fit the typical pattern of angina. The pain may be sharp, stabbing, or burning and may occur in different locations, such as the back, shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or abdomen. It may not be relieved by rest or medication.4. **Non-Anginal Chest Pain**: This term refers to chest pain or discomfort that is not caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. It may be due to other conditions such as acid reflux, muscle strain, or anxiety.In terms of chest pain frequency in heart attacks, it's essential to note that chest pain is a common symptom, but it may vary in presentation and severity among individuals. While typical angina may present more frequently with classic chest pain symptoms, atypical angina and non-anginal chest pain can also be associated with heart attacks, especially in certain populations such as women, older adults, and individuals with diabetes and If you are talking about \"Asymptomatic Angina\", this term means heart tension that occurs without obvious symptoms or without pain or other symptoms. But this concept alone has a contradiction. Because if the patient has no signs of pain or other symptoms, this condition probably cannot be considered as \"angina\", because \"angina\" is a symptom of insufficient cardiac vascular supply to supply blood to the heart, resulting in pain or discomfort. defined in the chest. If the patient has no signs of pain or other symptoms, he may actually have a problem with his heart that has no obvious symptoms, such as some heart rhythm problems or vascular disorders that may develop into more serious problems over time. lead But using the phrase \"Asymptomatic Angina\" as a medical term usually doesn't make sense because it contradicts itself. In your phrase, \"Asymptomatic Angina\" probably means something else that it might refer to. If possible, provide more information about the concept you are looking for so that I can help better.</p>\n  - <p style = \"color:#226666\">Heart attacks occur more often in people who do not have blood sugar than in people who have blood sugar, so we conclude that heart attacks may occur in people who do not have blood sugar, and in less cases in people who have blood sugar. But heart attacks occur more often in this group of people</p>\n  - <p style = \"color:#226666\"> Interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) results from different aspects can help to diagnose and predict heart diseases. The information you provided appears to have been extracted from an ECG machine. Electrocardiography (ECG) is one of the most important diagnostic tools in cardiac medicine. This test measures the heart's electrical activity and records the various electrical patterns created by the heart's conduction system. ECG results can help doctors diagnose different types of heart problems, including heart attacks.1. **Normal state**: When the ECG shows normal results, it means there are no signs of heart problems. This includes the absence of signs such as increased or decreased ST segment and T wave caused by disturbances in the electrical activity of the heart. 2. **ST-T wave abnormality**: When ECG results show that the ST segment and T wave are out of their normal pattern, this may indicate signs of heart problems. These disorders are usually caused by factors such as cardiac ischemia (decreased blood supply to the heart muscle) or high blood pressure. 3. **Left ventricular hypertrophy (increase in the volume of the left ventricle)**: This can indicate an increase in the size and thickness of the left ventricle of the heart in the ECG results. This condition is usually caused by high blood pressure or other heart problems. Therefore, the analysis of ECG results is very important because it can help doctors to identify heart problems and provide appropriate treatment for the patient. Two important points obtained from these descriptions are: 1) People whose ECG is normal have a lower probability of heart attack. 2) People whose ECG shows ST-T wave abnormality or left ventricular hypertrophy. This information can help doctors improve through ECG evaluation to diagnose and predict the risks associated with heart disease. However, ECG interpretation requires the expertise and experience of the doctor and requires a more detailed study of the results and the patient's clinical environment in order to carry out correct and appropriate treatment measures.</p>\n  - <p style = \"color:#226666\">In exercise angina, those who had more exercise had more heart attacks, and yes, this may be due to the difference in the process and intensity of exercise. When a person does more sports activity, the heart needs more oxygen and blood to deal with this activity. If the exercise activity is not heavy or moderate enough, but the person feels pain or discomfort in the chest, this may be a sign of impaired blood supply to the heart muscle, which usually leads to a heart attack after going through the previous stages. Also, people Those who exercise a lot may be at higher risk due to other factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, or a family history of heart disease.\nIn any case, if a person experiences pain or discomfort in the chest, pressure or pressure in a part of the body such as the shoulders or arms, a feeling of unbalanced fatigue or extreme anxiety during exercise, it should be taken very seriously and see a doctor immediately.</p>\n  - <p style = \"color:#226666\"> this can be seen by the statistical results of the data. These data show that the type of ST slope in ECG results may be related to the rate and severity of heart attacks. 1. **Downsloping and flat ST slope**: If the ECG shows that the ST segment is downward (Downsloping) or flat (Flat), this may be a sign of dangerous factors such as cardiac ischemia. As a result, the number of people who fall into these two categories and have had a heart attack is more. 2. **Upsloping ST slope**: If the ST segment is upsloping, it probably indicates a condition that may cause more concern about the heart condition, but the probability of a heart attack is less in this category of people. This may be due to other factors such as lower cardiac risk factors in this group of people.</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"colum=dict(df21['chest pain type'].value_counts())","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"resting_ecg=dict(df21['resting ecg'].value_counts())","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ST_slope=dict(df21['ST slope'].value_counts())","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ext=dict(df21['exercise angina'].value_counts())","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dia=dict(df21['fasting blood sugar'].value_counts())","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"adf = pd.DataFrame({'Name':colum.keys(),'Values':colum.values()})","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"res= pd.DataFrame({'Name':resting_ecg.keys(),'Values':resting_ecg.values()})","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"st=pd.DataFrame({'Name':ST_slope.keys(),'Values':ST_slope.values()})","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ex=pd.DataFrame({'Name':ext.keys(),'Values':ext.values()})","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"di=pd.DataFrame({'Name':dia.keys(),'Values':dia.values()})","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"namesst=list(ST_slope.keys())\nvaluesst=list(ST_slope.values())","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"namesre=list(resting_ecg.keys())\nvaluesre=list(resting_ecg.values())","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"names=list(colum.keys())\nvalues=list(colum.values())","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"namesex=list(ext.keys())\nvaluesex=list(ext.values())","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"namesdi=list(dia.keys())\nvaluesdi=list(dia.values())","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"Pair_Plots2\"></a>\n\n# <p style=\"background-color:#00FFFF;font-family:Gabriola;color:#000080;font-size:150%;text-align:left;border-radius:10px 50px;\">   üî¥ Chest Pain Type  </p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://ssl.adam.com/graphics/multimedia/en/23817/23817ed.jpg)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'purple', 'orange']\nplt.title('Chest Pain type Distribution')\nplt.bar(adf['Name'],adf['Values'],color=colors)\nfor i in range(len(names)):\n    plt.text(i, values[i] + 0.5, str(values[i]), ha='center')","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style = \"font-size:150%; color:#226666\">üí° Result </p> \n<p style = \"color:#226666\"> The number of column samples with angioma is more than other columns</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_criteria = ['chest pain type', 'target']\ncm = sns.light_palette(\"red\", as_cmap=True)\ncross_tab = pd.crosstab(df21[plot_criteria[0]], df21[plot_criteria[1]], normalize='columns') * 100\nstyled_table = cross_tab.round(2).style.background_gradient(cmap=cm)\nstyled_table","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style = \"font-size:150%; color:#226666\">üí° Result </p> \n<p style = \"color:#226666\">These data show that the probability of heart attack is different depending on the type of chest pain. 1. **Asymptomatic (asymptomatic)**: People who do not have chest pain (asymptomatic), have the highest probability of having a heart attack.

This is a common test used to diagnose heart problems and to monitor the condition of the heart in many situations. Electrocardiogram - Also called ECG or EKG. But ECG has limitations. It measures heart rate and rhythm ‚Äî but doesn't necessarily indicate blocked arteries. This is the reason that in this data set, about 63% of heart patients have normal ECG and these data show that the type of ECG results (electrocardiography) can also have a direct relationship with the presence or absence of heart disease. 1. **ST-T Wave Abnormality**: People whose ECG results show that their ST segment and T wave are unbalanced or abnormal are more likely to have a heart attack. This group of people includes a higher percentage of heart patients. 2. **Left Ventricular Hypertrophy**: This condition refers to an increase in the size and thickness of the left ventricle of the heart in ECG results.

However, it's essential to understand that blood pressure alone is not the sole determinant of heart attack risk. Other factors, including cholesterol levels, lifestyle factors, family history, and overall cardiovascular health, also play significant roles.Typically, high blood pressure (hypertension) is a risk factor for heart disease, including heart attacks. Blood pressure readings are expressed as two numbers: systolic pressure (the top number) and diastolic pressure (the bottom number). A blood pressure reading of 120/80 mmHg is considered normal, while readings above this range may indicate elevated blood pressure.At blood pressure of 120, 130, 140, 110, and 150, there is a greater possibility that the patient will have heart attacks.It's essential for individuals with elevated blood pressure readings to monitor their blood pressure regularly, adopt heart-healthy lifestyle habits (such as a balanced diet, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol intake, and avoiding smoking), and work closely with their healthcare provider to manage their blood pressure effectively and reduce their risk of heart disease and heart attacks.</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"Pair_Plots2\"></a>\n\n# <p style=\"background-color:#00FFFF;font-family:Gabriola;color:#000080;font-size:150%;text-align:left;border-radius:10px 50px;\">   üî¥ cholesterol  </p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![heart](https://www.bhf.org.uk/-/media/images/information-support/heart-matters/2016/cholesterol-620x400-ssnoexp.png?rev=7ec1c086cc8a434ea9a11c8ad6ae99f7)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(50, 20))\nsorted_x2 = df8[selected_columns[1]].value_counts().index.sort_values()\nsns.countplot(x=selected_columns[1], hue='target',  data=df8, order=sorted_x2)\nplt.xticks(rotation=90) \nplt.title('Stacked Bar Chart')\nplt.show()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_criteria = [selected_columns[1], 'target']\ncm = sns.light_palette(\"red\", as_cmap=True)\ncross_tab = pd.crosstab(df21[plot_criteria[0]], df21[plot_criteria[1]], normalize='columns') * 100\nstyled_table = cross_tab.round(2).style.background_gradient(cmap=cm)\nstyled_table","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style = \"font-size:150%; color:#226666\">üí° Result </p> \n<p style = \"color:#226666\">Based on the information provided, it seems you're referring to cholesterol levels in relation to the likelihood of having a heart attack.

This usually indicates a high strain on the cardiovascular system, which can be due to physical stress or mental stress. The maximum heart rate is affected by many factors, including a person's level of physical activity, stressors, level of mental stress, and general state. his health For example, if a person is physically healthy and athletic and mentally calm, his maximum heart rate may be higher, but the probability of heart attacks in him is lower.

These types of analyzes can be useful in clinical evaluations and understanding complications or symptoms associated with various diseases.</p>\n  - <p style = \"color:#226666\">If, in a medical study, we want to compare the distribution of characteristics such as non-typical angina symptoms between two groups of people (with heart disease and without heart disease), we may come across negative biases. If the study shows that people with heart disease Hearts experience less symptoms of non-typical angina compared to people without heart disease, this could indicate the existence of a negative skew. In other words, the probability of having non-typical angina symptoms in people with heart disease is less than in people without heart disease.

If the study shows that the asymptomatic characteristic in both groups (with heart disease and without heart disease) has a normal distribution, this can be considered as a strong hypothesis. be used in statistical analyses. In other words, we can use the hypothesis of normal distribution for the distribution of asymptomatic characteristics in two groups of patients and controls. In this case, the information obtained from the normal distribution can be used in various statistical analyzes such as t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), or models. Regression was used to examine the relationship between asymptomatic and other variables related to heart disease. This information can help us better understand this feature and its impact on heart disease.</p>\n  - <p style = \"color:#226666\">If the study shows that the characteristic of typical angina in people with heart disease has a normal distribution, and at the same time in people without heart disease, this characteristic has a positive skew, this can indicate a significant difference in the distribution of this characteristic between the two groups. A positive skewness in typical angina for people who have heart disease means that the average value of typical angina for them is higher than the general average of the population, while for people who do not have heart disease, this value is lower than the average of the population. These results can play an important role in the diagnosis and prediction of heart disease. If typical angina is more common in people with heart disease, these symptoms may be considered as a predictor of heart disease.

It shows what percentage of samples predicted as positive were actually positive.\n - **Recall**: the ratio of correct positive predictions to all real positive samples. It shows what percentage of true positive samples are correctly identified by the model.\n\n2. **curve features**:\n - The accuracy-retrieval curve shows the accuracy (y-axis) versus the recall (x-axis) at different levels of thresholds.\n - In the model curve, the accuracy starts from a high value and decreases with increasing recycling.\n\n3. **Commentary**:\n - **High accuracy and high recovery**: This is the ideal scenario where the model has very few false positive and false negative errors. In the model curve, this part of the curve is located near the upper-right corner.\n - **Balance between accuracy and recycling**: As recycling increases, accuracy usually decreases and vice versa. This balance can be seen in the curve of the model, where the accuracy decreases sharply after a certain point.\n - **high recovery, lower accuracy**: the sharp drop at the end of the curve indicates that the accuracy is drastically reduced to achieve maximum recovery. This means that while the model detects almost all positives, it also produces a large number of false positives.\n\n4. **Model performance**:\n - The model curve shows that the model performs well for most ranges, so that high accuracy is maintained with high recovery. A steep drop at the end of the curve indicates that after a certain point, the model starts generating too many false positives to identify the few remaining positive samples.\n - The general shape of the curve indicates a strong performance of the model, especially in the range where the recovery is between 0.0 and about 0.9 and the accuracy remains close to 1.0.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe precision-retrieval curve shows that your model performs well in identifying positives and keeps the number of false positives low for a wide range of thresholds. A sharp drop off at the end of the curve is typical and represents the point where the model sacrifices accuracy to achieve greater recovery. Considering that in medical applications high recycling is often of critical importance, the ability of this model to maintain high accuracy over a large extent of recycling is a significant positive result.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def plot_roc_curve(y_true, y_proba):\n    fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_true, y_proba)\n    roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_true, y_proba)\n    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\n    plt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='darkorange', lw=2, label='ROC curve (AUC = %0.2f)' % roc_auc)\n    plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='navy', lw=2, linestyle='--')\n    plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')\n    plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')\n    plt.title('ROC Curve')\n    plt.legend()\n    plt.show()\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_roc_curve(y_test, y_pred_et100)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style = \"font-size:150%; color:#226666\">üí° Result </p> \n\n### ROC curve analysis\n\n1. **Curved axes**:\n - **y-axis (True Positive Rate or sensitivity)**: the ratio of correct positive predictions to all true positive samples.\n - **x-axis (False Positive Rate)**: the ratio of false positive predictions to all true negative samples.\n\n2. **dotted blue line (baseline)**:\n - This line represents the performance of a stochastic model that has no special predictive capabilities.

This value shows that the model has a very good ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.\n\n2. **curve position**:\n - Your model's ROC curve is near the upper-left corner, indicating a high True Positive Rate and a low False Positive Rate. This means that the model correctly identifies a large number of true positives and falsely predicts a small number of true negatives.\n\n3. **use in decision-making**:\n - The ROC curve allows you to try different thresholds for predictions and see their effect on true positive and false positive rates. This can be very useful in tuning the model for specific applications (such as greater sensitivity in disease detection).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe ROC curve of this model shows a very strong performance and a high ability of the model to correctly distinguish positive and negative samples. An AUC value of 0.95 indicates that your model is very effective at discriminating between classes and can identify positives well while false positives few negatives.","metadata":{}}]}
